# Spatial Queries

An important aspect of working with big geospatial data is the ability to filter based on spatio-temporal predicates. RasterFrames uses [GeoMesa Spark JTS](http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/current/user/spark/spark_jts.html) for specifying and executing spatial queries against RasterFrame data sources.
